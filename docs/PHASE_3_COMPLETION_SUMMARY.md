├── Phase 1: Vector Memory (Semantic Search) ✅
├── Phase 2: Enhanced Context Manager (Conversation Threading) ✅  
└── Phase 3: Player Profiles (Behavior Tracking) ✅ NEW!
```

### 📁 New Files Created

#### 1. `src/player_profiles.py` (777 lines)
**The heart of Phase 3** - Complete player behavior tracking and personality system:

**Key Features:**
- **Player Extraction**: Intelligent parsing of ARK server logs to identify player names
- **Event Analysis**: Categorizes player actions (taming, deaths, building, PvP, etc.)
- **Personality Traits**: Tracks 5 personality dimensions (tamer, builder, aggressive, social, explorer)
- **Behavior Patterns**: Learning system that adapts to player preferences over time
- **Database Integration**: Three new tables for persistent player data storage
- **Caching System**: High-performance profile caching with automatic expiry
- **Context Generation**: AI-friendly player summaries for enhanced commentary

**Core Classes:**
```python
class PlayerProfileManager:
    - extract_players_from_logs()      # Parse logs for player names
    - analyze_event_type()             # Categorize player actions  
    - update_player_profile()          # Update behavior tracking
    - get_player_context()             # Generate AI context
    - process_logs_for_profiles()      # Complete workflow integration
    - get_contextual_player_summaries() # Multi-player context
```

#### 2. `tests/test_player_profiles.py` (580 lines)
**Comprehensive test suite** covering all player profile functionality:
- 16 individual test methods
- Unit tests for all core methods
- Integration tests with database
- Performance testing with large datasets
- Edge case handling and robustness testing

#### 3. `tests/test_phase3_integration.py` (320 lines)  
**Complete system integration tests** verifying all three phases work together:
- Cross-component data consistency verification
- Complete AI context generation workflow testing
- Player personality evolution over time testing
- Performance testing with realistic workloads

### 🔧 Integration Points

#### Modified: `src/main.py`
**Seamlessly integrated** Player Profiles into existing AI workflow:

```python
# New import added
from src.player_profiles import PlayerProfileManager

# Initialization in Application.__init__()
self.player_profiles = PlayerProfileManager(self.db)

# Integration in process_server_logs()
self.player_profiles.process_logs_for_profiles(lines, server_name)
players_in_logs = self.player_profiles.extract_players_from_logs(lines)
player_context = self.player_profiles.get_contextual_player_summaries(players_in_logs)

# Integration in process_cluster_logs()  
# Same pattern for cluster-wide player tracking
```

### 🗄️ Database Schema Extensions

**Three new tables** added automatically by PlayerProfileManager:

#### `player_profiles`
```sql
CREATE TABLE player_profiles (
    player_name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_seen TIMESTAMP,
    last_seen TIMESTAMP, 
    total_sessions INTEGER,
    personality_type TEXT,
    profile_data TEXT,  -- JSON with detailed behavior data
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### `player_events`  
```sql
CREATE TABLE player_events (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    player_name TEXT,
    event_type TEXT,
    event_details TEXT,  -- JSON with event specifics
    server_name TEXT,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### `player_relationships`
```sql
CREATE TABLE player_relationships (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    player1 TEXT,
    player2 TEXT, 
    relationship_type TEXT,  -- tribe, ally, rival, friend
    strength REAL,
    last_interaction TIMESTAMP
);
```

## 🚀 Player Profile Features

### 🎯 Intelligent Player Detection
**Advanced log parsing** that recognizes players in various contexts:
```python
# Handles multiple log patterns:
patterns = [
    r'(\w+) tamed',           # "Sletty tamed a Level 150 Rex"
    r'(\w+) died',            # "Impinchi died to a Giga"  
    r'(\w+) placed',          # "Bob placed Foundation"
    r'(\w+) said',            # "Alice said: 'Hello!'"
    # ... and more
]
```

### 🦕 Dinosaur Categorization System
**Smart dino classification** for behavior analysis:
```python
dino_categories = {
    'utility': ['ankylo', 'doedicurus', 'beaver'],    # Resource gatherers
    'combat': ['rex', 'giga', 'spino'],               # Fighting dinos
    'transport': ['argentavis', 'quetzal', 'wyvern'], # Flying/carrying
    'tek': ['tek parasaur', 'tek rex', 'tek stego'],  # High-tech dinos
    'rare': ['wyvern', 'griffin', 'phoenix']          # Special creatures
}
```

### 🎭 Personality Trait System
**5-dimensional personality tracking** that evolves over time:

```python
personality_traits = {
    'tamer': 0.0,      # Loves collecting dinosaurs
    'builder': 0.0,    # Focuses on construction  
    'aggressive': 0.0, # Engages in PvP combat
    'social': 0.0,     # Active in chat/community
    'explorer': 0.0    # Ventures into new areas
}
```

**Personality Types Generated:**
- "dinosaur enthusiast" (high tamer trait)
- "master architect" (high builder trait)
- "PvP warrior" (high aggressive trait)
- "community leader" (high social trait)
- "adventurous survivor" (high explorer trait)
- "casual player" (low all traits)

### 📊 Behavioral Analytics
**Comprehensive activity tracking:**
```python
profile_data = {
    'favorite_dinos': {'Rex': 5, 'Parasaur': 12},    # Dino preferences
    'dino_categories': {'utility': 8, 'combat': 3},   # Category preferences
    'death_count': 47,                                # Survival skills
    'taming_count': 23,                               # Taming activity
    'building_count': 156,                            # Construction activity
    'pvp_encounters': 12,                             # Combat involvement
    'notable_events': [],                             # Special achievements
    'server_preferences': {},                         # Server loyalty
}
```

## 🤖 AI Context Integration

### 📝 Enhanced AI Commentary
**Player Profiles provide rich context** for AI response generation:

**Before Phase 3:**
```
"A player tamed a Rex on the server today."
```

**After Phase 3:**  
```
"Sletty continues their obsession with Tek creatures, adding yet another 
Tek Rex to their growing mechanical zoo! With 23 tames and counting, 
this dinosaur enthusiast shows no signs of slowing down."
```

### 🎯 Context Examples
**Real AI context generated by Player Profiles:**

```
PLAYER CONTEXT (for personalized commentary):
Sletty is a dinosaur enthusiast who loves taming Tek Parasaurs. Notable: 23 tames
Impinchi is a casual player. Notable: 47 deaths  
Bob is a master architect who loves building. Notable: 156 structures built
Alice is a community leader who loves chat
```

## 📈 Performance & Scalability
