# 🧠 **AI Memory System Implementation Plan for FunnyCommentator**

## 📋 **Detailed Hybrid Approach Breakdown**

### **Component 1: Vector Database + Embeddings** 🎯

#### **How It Works:**
```python
class VectorMemoryManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.chroma_client = chromadb.Client()
        self.collection = self.chroma_client.create_collection("ark_memories")
        
    def store_memory(self, response, logs, metadata):
        # Create embedding from response + original logs context
        embedding_text = f"{response}\n\nOriginal Context: {logs}"
        embedding = self.create_embedding(embedding_text)
        
        self.collection.add(
            embeddings=[embedding],
            documents=[response],
            metadatas=[{
                "server": metadata["server"],
                "date": metadata["date"],
                "players": metadata["players"],
                "event_types": metadata["event_types"]  # taming, death, join/leave
            }],
            ids=[f"{metadata['server']}_{metadata['date']}_{hash(response)}"]
        )
    
    def search_memories(self, current_logs, server_name, limit=5):
        query_embedding = self.create_embedding(current_logs)
        results = self.collection.query(
            query_embeddings=[query_embedding],
            where={"server": server_name},
            n_results=limit
        )
        return results["documents"][0]  # Similar past responses
```

#### **Pros:**
- ✅ **Semantic Understanding**: Finds "Sletty taming Tek dinos" even if described differently
- ✅ **Infinite Memory**: Can remember events from months ago
- ✅ **Context Awareness**: Knows player patterns, base locations, recurring drama
- ✅ **Cross-Event Correlation**: Links related events across time
- ✅ **Scalable**: Performance doesn't degrade with more memories
- ✅ **Flexible Queries**: Can search by player, event type, similarity

#### **Cons:**
- ❌ **Setup Complexity**: Requires ChromaDB installation and configuration
- ❌ **Embedding Costs**: Each memory storage/search uses embedding API calls
- ❌ **Storage Overhead**: Embeddings take more space than raw text
- ❌ **Dependency**: Another service to maintain and monitor
- ❌ **Similarity Accuracy**: May retrieve irrelevant but similar-sounding events

### **Component 2: Recent Context Manager** ⏰

#### **How It Works:**
```python
class RecentContextManager:
    def __init__(self, db_manager):
        self.db = db_manager
        
    def get_recent_summaries(self, server_name, days=7):
        # Get last week's responses for immediate context
        return self.db.get_summaries_since(server_name, days_ago=days)
    
    def get_conversation_thread(self, server_name, max_responses=3):
        # Get last few responses to maintain conversation flow
        return self.db.get_latest_summaries(server_name, limit=max_responses)
```

#### **Pros:**
- ✅ **Immediate Relevance**: Recent events are most important for context
- ✅ **Fast Access**: Database queries are very fast
- ✅ **Conversation Flow**: Maintains natural progression of commentary
- ✅ **No External Dependencies**: Uses existing database
- ✅ **Reliable**: No API calls or external services needed

#### **Cons:**
- ❌ **Limited Scope**: Only covers recent timeframe
- ❌ **No Semantic Search**: Can't find related old events
- ❌ **Fixed Time Window**: Might miss important but older context
- ❌ **Repetition Risk**: May still repeat if similar recent events

### **Component 3: Player Profile Memory** 👥

#### **How It Works:**
```python
class PlayerProfileManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.profiles = {}  # Cache player behavior patterns
        
    def update_player_profile(self, player_name, event_type, details):
        if player_name not in self.profiles:
            self.profiles[player_name] = {
                "favorite_dinos": {},
                "death_count": 0,
                "join_frequency": [],
                "notable_events": []
            }
        
        profile = self.profiles[player_name]
        
        if event_type == "taming":
            dino = details.get("dino_type")
            profile["favorite_dinos"][dino] = profile["favorite_dinos"].get(dino, 0) + 1
            
    def get_player_context(self, player_name):
        if player_name in self.profiles:
            profile = self.profiles[player_name]
            return f"{player_name} is known for: {profile['favorite_dinos']}, dies often: {profile['death_count']} times"
        return f"{player_name} is a new or occasional player"
```

#### **Pros:**
- ✅ **Personality Awareness**: AI knows "Sletty loves Tek Parasaurs"
- ✅ **Behavioral Patterns**: Recognizes player habits and preferences
- ✅ **Personalized Jokes**: Tailors humor to specific players
- ✅ **Relationship Dynamics**: Understands tribe interactions
- ✅ **Progressive Learning**: Gets better at understanding players over time

#### **Cons:**
- ❌ **Privacy Concerns**: Stores detailed player behavior data
- ❌ **Maintenance Overhead**: Profiles need updating and cleanup
- ❌ **Storage Growth**: Player data accumulates indefinitely
- ❌ **Complexity**: Parsing events to extract player behavior is complex
- ❌ **Stale Data**: Players might change behavior over time

---

### **Component 4: Event Pattern Recognition** 🔍

#### **How It Works:**
```python
class EventPatternManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.patterns = {
            "taming_sprees": [],  # Multiple tames in short time
            "death_chains": [],   # Multiple deaths in sequence
            "base_raids": [],     # PvP attack patterns
            "mass_events": []     # Server-wide events
        }
    
    def detect_patterns(self, recent_logs):
        patterns_found = []
        
        # Detect taming spree: 3+ tames in 30 minutes
        taming_events = [log for log in recent_logs if "Tamed" in log]
        if len(taming_events) >= 3:
            patterns_found.append("taming_spree")
            
        return patterns_found
    
    def get_pattern_context(self, pattern_type):
        return f"This appears to be a {pattern_type} - you've commented on similar situations before."
```

#### **Pros:**
- ✅ **Situation Recognition**: Knows when events are part of larger patterns
- ✅ **Dynamic Response**: Adjusts tone based on event magnitude
- ✅ **Contextual Relevance**: Links current events to historical patterns
- ✅ **Escalation Awareness**: Recognizes when normal becomes extraordinary
- ✅ **Server Health Insights**: Can detect unusual activity patterns

#### **Cons:**
- ❌ **Pattern Definition**: Hard to define what constitutes each pattern
- ❌ **False Positives**: May misidentify normal events as patterns
- ❌ **Complexity**: Pattern detection logic can become very complex
- ❌ **Maintenance**: Patterns need tuning based on server behavior
- ❌ **Performance**: Real-time pattern detection adds processing overhead

## 🏗️ **Complete Implementation Architecture**

```python
class HybridAIMemorySystem:
    def __init__(self, config, database):
        self.vector_memory = VectorMemoryManager()
        self.recent_context = RecentContextManager(database)
        self.player_profiles = PlayerProfileManager()
        self.pattern_detector = EventPatternManager()
        
    async def generate_response_with_memory(self, logs, server_name):

        vector_memories = self.vector_memory.search_memories(logs, server_name)
        recent_context = self.recent_context.get_recent_summaries(server_name)
        
        # 2. Extract player info and detect patterns
        players = self.extract_players_from_logs(logs)
        player_contexts = [self.player_profiles.get_player_context(p) for p in players]
        patterns = self.pattern_detector.detect_patterns(logs)
        
        # 3. Build rich context
        memory_context = f"""
        SEMANTIC MEMORIES (similar past situations):
        {chr(10).join(vector_memories)}
        
        RECENT CONTEXT (last week):
        {chr(10).join(recent_context)}
        
        PLAYER PROFILES:
        {chr(10).join(player_contexts)}
        
        DETECTED PATTERNS: {', '.join(patterns)}
        
        Generate a unique response that acknowledges relevant memories without repeating them.
        """
        
        # 4. Generate response
        response = await self.ai_manager.generate_with_context(logs, memory_context)
        
        # 5. Store new memory
        await self.store_new_memory(response, logs, server_name, players)
        
        return response
```
